# Writing Introduction

:bulb: This section is partly based on Unit 8 of Academic Writing for Graduate Students (3rd Ed). See the Reference below for the detail.

## Five main functions of Introduction

Introduction should have at least the following five functions.

1. Establishing a research area
1. Establishing a niche or opportunity
1. Stating the research aim (and objectives)
1. Describing the proposed research challenge
1. Structure of the remaining content

### Establishing a research area

- Show that the research area is important, central to a significant technological advance, interesting or problematic.
- Cite any statics to demonstrate the scale of the research area or potential impact of the technologies / services

### Establishing a niche or opportunity

- Describe the major developments, findings, contributions in the area by citing reprentative work
- Point out either
    - major limitations (gaps) of existing work / approaches
    - great opportunities presented due to the change of environment or emergence of new technologies / services

### Stating the research aim

- Declare the main aim and objectives of your research based on your critical view of existing work's limitation or leveraging new opportunities presented by previous work
- If appropriate, present the research hypotheses and justify why the hypotheses are worth validating using literature

### Describing the proposed research challenge

- Clarify that the research aim proposed above is not a trivial work by describing the major research challenges you will face to achieve the goal
- What's the difficulty in achieving the goal which non-domain experts might underestimate and think "oh, that can be done in a week"?
- Briefly describe how you plan to overcome the challenge.

### Structure of the remining content

- Briefly introduce the content of subsequent sections
- Some people argue that this section is redundant while other reviewers complain if you don't have one.

> #sigir2013 Tip 3. Intro: What are you doing? Why is it interesting and novel? Will I learn something in the next hour? 1/2 to 3/4 page max.
