# Writing an outline

:bulb: It is very important that your writing process gets started with an outline.
Do not spend a large amount of time of writing before you have a solid outline.
It is also a good idea to get a feedback from your supervisor on your outline,
because it is easy and quick to get one with an outline.

## Why make an outline?

- An outline encourages you to think hard about an overall structure of your writing (i.e., story).
- An outline allows you to initiate your writing from a section that is the easiest to write (and thus progress!).
- An outline is the best way to get a quick feedback from your supervisor.
- An outlne enables you to keep track of your writing and the overall story even when you write sections in non-linear order.
- An outline allows you to estimate the total amount of time it will take to complete the first draft.

## What does an outline look like?

:bulb: Try to write your outline to at least the 3rd level of depths (i.e., 1.1.1) so that a good level of details are presented. Introduction and Conclusion might be completed with the 2nd levels.
If you can't write some section to the 3rd level in Methods, Results, and Discussions, it might indicate that your ideas are not fully clear (and thus writing might not present clear ideas!).

1. Introduction
    1. Research Space
    1. Limitations or Opportunities

## I made an outline. Now what?

- Share that with your supervisor and see if the order of items makes sense or if there is any missing items.
- Pin the outline in front of your desk while you're writing so that you do not loose the overall structure of the paper.
- Start writing from a small section where you have the clearest idea about what to write.
- Do not hesitate to update the outline as you make progress with your writing. An outline is always a temporal blueprint which should be revised until the final draft.

## What tools should I use to make an outline?

Anything is fine. Don't waste your time to explore and establish the "outline generation" environment (like me)!
